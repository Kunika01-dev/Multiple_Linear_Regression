<h2>Problem Statement: </h2>
<h3>A real estate company has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

Essentially, the company wants —

✔️To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

✔️To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.

✔️To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.</h3><br>
<h3>The dataset is provided in the repository<h3>
    <h3>✔️'housing.csv'</h3>
 ▶️<i>Three models are created- lm_1, lm_2, lm_3 with different number of features.</i><br>
  <h3>✔️ Performance metrics for each model is compared and the best fit model is predicted. </h3>
